In the spring of my junior year at Harvard, I took a signal processing class at MIT. I found Fourier analysis fascinating and this repo is some of my explorations in the class. However, it's only some because I was disorganized and couldn't find the rest of my labs. Anyone familiar with CAT-SOOP knows how easy it is for the Profs to scrap all your submissions from the course website at the end of the semester! Haha.
